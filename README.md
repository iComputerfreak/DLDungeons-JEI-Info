# DLDungeons JEI Info
A Minecraft 1.12.2 JEI Plugin that shows an Info tab for the items that can be found in the DoomLike Dungeons.

Highly WIP. Currently only supports specialized chest configs. The mod searches for the DoomLike Dungeons config folder and it's `SpecialChests` subfolder.
It then reads the loot tables and parses them to add descriptions.

There is no config or anything. You just add the Mod and the items that can be looted in the dungeons should have an extra info tab in JEI.

Look in the Releases tab for pre-compiled jars.
